### Primer
A primer, also known as a **Paint primer** or **Priming coat**, is a preparatory coating applied to a surface before the application of paint.

Primers serve several purposes:

* **Surface Preparation:** Primers help to prepare the surface for painting by sealing it, filling in small imperfections, and creating a smooth and uniform base for the paint.
* **Adhesion:** Primers improve the adhesion of the paint to the surface, helping to prevent peeling, flaking, or cracking of the paint over time.
* **Protection:** Primers can provide additional protection to the surface by blocking stains, inhibiting rust or corrosion on metal surfaces, and preventing moisture penetration.
* **Enhanced Paint Performance:** Using a primer can enhance the performance of the paint by promoting even coverage, improving color vibrancy, and extending the lifespan of the paint job.
